Solving Bin Packing Problem in NEOS Server using Perl.

The bin packing problem is an optimization problem, in which items of different sizes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers, each of a fixed given capacity, in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. The problem has many applications, such as filling up containers, loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, creating file backups in media and technology mapping in FPGA semiconductor chip design.

Here we demonstrate the use of Perl programming language to model and solve a small problem using [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) as a solver engine, via NEOS Server service.

The **NEOS Server** is a free internet-based service for solving numerical optimization problems. Hosted by the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the NEOS Server provides access to more than 60 state-of-the-art solvers in more than a dozen optimization categories. Solvers hosted by the University of Wisconsin in Madison run on distributed high-performance machines enabled by the HTCondor software; remote solvers run on machines at Arizona State University, the University of Klagenfurt in Austria, and the University of Minho in Portugal.
